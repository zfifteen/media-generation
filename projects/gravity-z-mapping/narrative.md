Gravity's Hidden Structure. Z-Mapping the Low-Acceleration Regime.

We begin with three parameters that form the foundation of this analysis.

Parameter A, shown in yellow, is the observed gravity boost. In wide binary star systems measured by the Gaia satellite, gravity appears stronger than Newton predicted. The gamma factor equals three halves, or one point five.

Parameter B, shown in green, is the theory ratio. This captures the gap between two competing frameworks. Quantised Inertia predicts a minimum acceleration threshold, while Modified Newtonian Dynamics predicts a slightly different critical value. Their ratio equals five thirds, or approximately one point six seven.

Parameter C, shown in red, is the Newtonian ceiling. Standard physics predicts gamma equals one. This is the upper limit of what classical gravitational theory permits.

Now we apply the Z-mapping formula. Z equals A times B divided by C.

Substituting our values, Z equals three halves times five thirds over one.

Simplifying, Z equals three halves times five thirds.

Notice the structure of these fractions. The numerator of the first fraction is three. The denominator of the second fraction is also three.

Watch carefully. These threes cancel each other perfectly.

The result is Z equals five halves, which equals two point five exactly.

The threes cancel. Coupling revealed.

This cancellation is not a coincidence. It reveals that the gravity boost measured in wide binary stars and the gap between the two competing theories are mathematically coupled through a shared scaling factor.

Now let's examine what this number means. The Gravitational Budget.

The pie chart shows two sectors. The red sector represents the Newtonian contribution, forty percent. The yellow sector represents the anomalous contribution, sixty percent.

Z equals two point five implies one over Z equals zero point four.

Classical physics owns less than half the story. In the ultra-low acceleration regime, standard Newtonian gravity can only account for forty percent of the gravitational influence. The remaining sixty percent requires new physics, whether dark matter, modified gravity, or another mechanism.

This is the hidden structure of gravity at the edges of the universe.
